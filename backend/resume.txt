TECHNICAL PROJECTS

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent | Demo: http://35.182.40.143:8501
•	Used full stack AI RAG agent to enable users to upload documents, ask questions, and get answers or summaries.
•	Implemented backend in FastAPI with OpenAI models. API development includes session-based architecture and temporary file cleanup for secure and efficient operations.
•	Utilized Docker for containerized deployment, Streamlit interface for frontend and AWS EC2 for hosting.

Time Series Forecasting with XGBoost | Demo: m4-weekly-frontend.onrender.com
•	Developed a time series forecasting solution using the M4 weekly dataset, leveraging advanced feature engineering (cyclic, lagged, and rolling features), stationarity analysis and global XGBoost model with RandomizedSearchCV.
•	Designed a robust pipeline for data preprocessing, model deployment, and API integration using FastAPI for real-time predictions, hosted on Render.
•	Incorporated Population Stability Index (PSI) and feature importance analysis for model evaluation & drift detection.

Data-Driven Reddit Opinion Mining System | Demo: http://lumicore.duckdns.org
•	Worked with a team to develop a full-stack web application to evaluate user opinions by analyzing user-generated content from Reddit and Google search results. 
•	Helped in engineering a robust data pipeline integrating PostgreSQL for persistent storage and efficient query handling, enabling large-scale analysis of user comments from Reddit.
•	Applied advanced NLP techniques for sentiment classification, keyword extraction, and summarization, producing actionable insights from aggregated data.
